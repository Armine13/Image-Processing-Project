\section{Final remarks} \label{sc:final-remarks}
The K-SVD algorithm was compared against different well-known techniques for denoising images such as mean, median, lee and wavelet-based filter. The algorithm was analysed in terms of the influence of its parameters on the results and, also, on its capability to remove noise.

The evaluation showed that the K-SVD algorithm was able to denoise synthetic and SD-OCT images achieving better results in some cases compared to the other algorithms.  Although noise was reduced, the segmentation carried out on an OCT volume evidenced that no significant improvement was observed between noisy and denoised images.

The K-SVD algorithm is recommended for removing noise on SD-OCT images since, in terms of PSNR, the results were the best. However, further evaluation on the segmentation section should be done in order to determine the best parameters for this task.
